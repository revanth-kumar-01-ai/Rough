There is little agreement as to the scope of the subject but the aim of this work is to provide comprehensive and up-to-date coverage within a book which will be of manageable proportions.</div><div class="numpara" title="Numbered Paragraph" data-ele="core:para" xwebid="d1e13" data-attr="{'edpnum-start':'2'}"><span class="numlbl" data-type="pnum-start" contenteditable="false">2</span>In the view of the author this requires discussion of the contractual liability of vendors and other suppliers of goods (Division II) no less than the tortious liability of producers and others (Division III). Contractual liability is indeed of paramount importance where the essence of a complaint is that a product is shoddy as opposed to unsafe. This is an area in which legislative reform has been most marked, notably with the passing of the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973, the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982, the Sale and Supply of Goods Act 1994 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994. However, it is in the law of tort where the most far-reaching changes have taken place with the coming into force on 1 March 1988 of Pt I of the Consumer Protection Act 1987. This Act, which is founded on an impressive range of reports from within the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe,<span class="fnlabel" data-ele="fn:footnote" data-href="#fn0001" id="fnref0001" title="Footnote reference">1</span> introduces a system of strict liability for defective products which operates alongside the traditional system of negligence-based liability. Since defective products which are manufactured in one jurisdiction frequently cause damage in another, the issues raised by a conflict of laws are particularly important in this area. This receives detailed treatment in Division VI.</div><div class="fndesp" xwebid="d6e20" style="display: block;" data-mce-style="display: block;"><div class="fnpara" id="fn0001" data-ele="fn:footnote" xwebid="d1e15" title="Footnote Description" data-attr="{'fr':'1'}" style=""><p class="normal" data-fnnum="1" title="Footnote Label"><a class="fntext" contenteditable="false" href="#fnref0001" data-mce-href="#fnref0001">1</a></p><p class="normal" xwebid="d1e16" data-ele="core:para" title="Footnote Paragraph">See eg the report of the Law Commission ‘Liability for Defective Products,’ Law Com No 82, Cmnd 6831, June 1977; the report of the Royal Commission on Civil Liability and Compensation for Personal Injury (Pearson Commission), Cmnd 7054, 1978 Vol 1, Ch 22; the European Convention on Products Liability in regard to Personal Injury and Death (the Council of Europe Convention); and the EEC Council Directive relating to the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products.

The Consumer Protection Act 1987 repeals the Consumer Safety Act 1978 and the Consumer Safety (Amendment) Act 1986, and the earlier Consumer Protection Act 1961 is repealed by the Consumer Safety Act 1978. However regulations made under the 1961 Act continue in force with modifications, as do regulations made under the 1978 Act.</div><div class="numpara" title="Numbered Paragraph" data-ele="core:para" xwebid="d1e23" data-attr="{'edpnum-end':'6', 'edpnum-start':'5'}"><span class="numlbl" data-type="pnum-start-end" contenteditable="false">5-6</span>Frequently, statutes and, in particular, regulations are linked closely to European developments, most notably European Economic Community directives. This was the case, eg, with Pt I of the Consumer Protection Act 1987. A selection of relevant directives, including the Council Directive relating to the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products, is printed in Division V.</div><div class="numpara" title="Numbered Paragraph" data-ele="core:para" xwebid="d1e25" data-attr="{'edpnum-start':'7'}"><span class="numlbl" data-type="pnum-start" contenteditable="false">7</span>Although convenience in exposition justifies the broad division which has been made between contractual and tortious liability (Divisions II and III) and the use of the criminal law to promote product safety (Division IV) there is nonetheless frequent overlap between the two. Two examples may be cited. The first is the position with respect to exemption clauses in consumer transactions for the purchase of goods. Here experience showed that it was insufficient simply to provide, as was done in the Supply of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973 (see now the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977), that such clauses were void. Consumers continued to be misled by notices in shops and elsewhere proclaiming that ‘Goods will not be returned or money refunded’. It was accordingly necessary to invoke the criminal law and make an order under Pt II of the Fair Trading Act 1973 whereby it was unlawful in the circumstances designated to mislead consumers as to their legal rights<span class="fnlabel" data-ele="fn:footnote" data-href="#fn0002" id="fnref0002" title="Footnote reference">1</span>. Conversely breach of certain regulations might give rise not only to criminal liability but also to a civil action at the suit of any person affected by the breach. This is the position under, for example, the Consumer Protection Act 1987, s 41(1). Other statutes specifically provide that the contravention of their terms shall not affect civil rights and liabilities<span class="fnlabel" data-ele="fn:footnote" data-href="#fn0003" id="fnref0003" title="Footnote reference">2</span>.</div><div class="fndesp" xwebid="d6e39" style="display: block;" data-mce-style="display: block;"><div class="fnpara" id="fn0002" data-ele="fn:footnote" xwebid="d1e27" title="Footnote Description" data-attr="{'fr':'1'}"><p class="normal" data-fnnum="1" title="Footnote Label"><a class="fntext" contenteditable="false" href="#fnref0002" data-mce-href="#fnref0002">1</a></p><p class="normal" xwebid="d1e28" data-ele="core:para" title="Footnote Paragraph">See the Consumer Transactions (Restrictions on Statements) Order 1976, SI 1976/1813 as amended by SI 1978/127, Div IV.

The reason why the work contains a high proportion of annotated statutes and regulations is that it is essential that the user seeking practical guidance should have access to the primary sources.</div><div class="numpara" title="Numbered Paragraph" data-ele="core:para" xwebid="d1e40" data-attr="{'edpnum-start':'9'}"><span class="numlbl" data-type="pnum-start" contenteditable="false">9</span>Nonetheless the work has been written in the belief that legislation is frequently understandable only against the background of discussion which preceded it. For this reason it has often been thought appropriate to refer to Law Commission papers, government ‘Green papers’ and to parliamentary debates and select committee reports.</div></div></div></div>
